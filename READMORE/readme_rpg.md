### Story and Gameplay

##### Story (Brief)

<The Summary or TL;DR version of below>

<a href="STORY"></a>
##### Story (Detailed)

The land of Ilythia is laiden with legends of heroes and magic. This story is
set at the start of a period of decline; a world in which the powers of the
surreal are beginning to fade. The player(characters) are unaware of this
decline, but slowly discover the sicklyness of the world; spellcasters’ spells
stop working as effectively and fail more often, paladins/clerics lose
connection, druid magic stops working, et cetera. As the players' adventures
continue, the problem becomes apparent and they’re dealing with it within their
small continent as a whole, but it becomes evident that other lands are sharing
the problem.

Ilythia is ruled by a royal family and council. It’s a kingdom on its knees,
already starting to fall apart at the seams.<sup>[1](#a1)</sup> The kingdom is being eaten away at
the edges bandits and robbers. The Monarchs try their best but can’t do anything.
The king is on the verge of giving up and the Queen withdraws from society,
but the crown prince is determined to fight to the end. He’ll do anything for
his kingdom, to save its people from the encroaching bleakness. He’s chaotic good.
He’s also cursed. This has something to do with the problem.


##### Gameplay (Brief)

<The Summary version of below>

##### Gameplay (Detailed)

(first news we hear about the problem is as a rumor from some foreigner who reports frightening things—pockets of darkness and black magic, places where magic doesn’t work and for someone like a wizard, whose magic is innate and part of them, it feels a little too much like being cut off from a piece of your soul)
They’re investigating a rumor about a nearby dungeon/town/? No one’s heard
anything from it in a long time. When they get there, the entire town is abandoned.
It’s eerily empty. The people are just… gone. No trace. They possibly find a
child who tells them a big bad monster in the nearby cave, gives them hints
about what happened here. Cave stuff bolah blah, it turns out there’s something
that’s been taking the people, so most left, many died. The monster itself… it’s
a monster (bugbear or something? Something level appropriate) but it’s…
different. Twisted. Blackened in some way. Shadow clings to its form and there
is black vein webbing its skin. Black fog shrouds the corners of the cave.
(a small encounter before they get to the town itself maybe? And one in the cave
before the final boss)

You’re in a small town, a very rural, agriculturally based village sort of place. You’re here because you’ve heard a few rather disturbing rumors from the people around here about one of the nearby town, Weatherstone. There’s been some sort of disturbance there. No one’s heard from the town in weeks, which is unusual. There’s been no one in or out, and everyone who’s gone there hasn’t returned. You guys are in town because you’d been planning to investigate these rumors, and the town is just the last pitstop before you head out. You know the town is about a day’s journey away, but there’s been a bad feeling crawling up your spin the closer and closer you get.
You head out and travel for 4, 5 hours in peace. Bandits. Possible info
The closer you get to Weatherstone, the bad feeling in your gut gets worse. Perception check (you see smoke in the distance, there’s a bad smell to the air). You travel for another 1 hour before reaching the town and you notice that it’s deathly quiet. No one has come out to greet you, there’s no sign of life, nothing. No animals, no people. (smoke is from a fire that’s burned out) some exploring
(perception check) there’s a small boy huddling in the corner of one of the abandoned houses. As soon as he notices you’ve seen him, he flies at you (roll an attack) you see he’s about 8 yr olds, shaking. Momma? Ryan. He tells u everyone’s gone, he got left behind. He’d went to the river to pick berries but fell asleep and slept the day and when he got everyone was gone. There’d been a body left behind. He didn’t kno what to do so he stayed. (mom always told me to stay put if I got lost). There’s something out there, in the cave, it had been eating people before everyone disappeared.
Make their way to the cave, they can loot buildings if they want
entrance of the cave is trapped (if triggered, goblins)
draw map of cave, two paths, one leads to the monster, one to the horde of goblins.
Boss monster, sick and grey and something’s terribly off. (if they like perception check) there’s a pile of bones in the back and what looks like half mangled body, but the bones look nowhere large enough to contain an entire town.
A dagger
Maybe some nicer armor
If they get back to that other town, have someone ask them what happened with that town. When they tell the story, people start listening, a merchant mentions some rumors from another continent (Vero) he’s been on. (perception check) there’s also a dark haired stranger listening intently to the conversation, altho pretending like he isn’t, he doesn’t say a word, just listens.
The next morning the bartender mentions that someone’s been looking for them. It’s the same stranger from last night that was listening in on their conversation. He says that he’s heard of their exploits and want them to do something for him.
New thing! If they decide to help then it’s some quest to get rid of a local noble who’s set himself up to be a tyrant. This kid’s the prince in disguise, the prince is a fighter? Rogue? Prince will be a bit higher level than them, bc hes a prince
If not, then they go off on idk who knos what. Random encounters, I suppose.
