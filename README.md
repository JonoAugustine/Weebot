# Weebot

*A discord bot that isn't another music player*

----
**Roadmap**

 1. Finish current basic settings implementations (changing settings, checking, etc)
 2. Work on *Joke/Insult Generator*(TM)
	- Possibly using a pool of joke templates and drawing from a pool of random words and phrases
 3.  Make *Cards against NL*
		- Send private messages to each player with their decks, send the white-card into the chat.
 4. Research chat-bot implementations for more natural conversations
	 - Possibly add a *sass-scale*(TM) to determine the level of jokes/insults/casual form with specific members.
		 - Will need to track stats and information about each individual member and define what acts increase or decrease relationship status with Weebot.
